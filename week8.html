                <div class="content">
                    <p>None of the PCB's I created for the previous weeks are functional. So, I wanted to create a new board, and more stable workflow for loading/testing software into it.</p>
                    <p>This time I focused on AVR's, and to keep everything simple and safe, I started from Neil's design (link here). To program the board via UPDI, I also created this (link here).</p>
                    <p>Using this (link here) cable adapter I followed (link here) to upload a sample echo (link here) program. In the first try, the program seemed to install, but when I connected the board through serial, it did not function.</p>
                    <p>On further trials, I had an error (insert error here) and later noticed that my cable adapter is the 3.3 volt version.</p>
                    <p>To provide the board with 5 volts, I used the power supply in the archshops which resulted in my attiny (add model no) board to literally get smoked.</p>

                        <li>Can I proceed with a 3.3 volt cable adapter? Or should I get a 5V one? -the existing board provides 5 volts.</li>
                        <li>Is it possible that my cable adapter is also damaged? -it is fine.</li>

                <button class="collapsible">Attiny412 Switch Board</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Trying to program an Attiny 412 with Kim, we came upon a design by Neil that includes an FTDI to UPDI conversion in a 6 pin serial connector.</p>
                    <p>Based on this idea, I created an Attiny 412 board with an LED and a phototransistor.</p>

                    </video>
                    <p>The great news is that this board can be programmed by connecting it to a PC via the USB to Serial adapter.</p>
                    <p>Bad news is that TX and RX pins of the serial connector are occupied by UPDI. So we can not communicate with the board after programming.</p>
                    <p>To solve the issue, I created a new design with two slider switches that allow the 6 pin serial connector to act as FTDI, and UPDI. Below is also the single switch prototype that can not transmit nor receive signals.</p>

                    <p>Now I have a board that can be programmed, and communicate through a single 6 pin serial connector and a USB to serial adapter.</p>

                    <p>For convenience in dark conditions, the LED turns of completely under a certain amount of light.</p>
                    <p>Just out of curiosity, I plugged the serial port to Unreal Engine 4 to create an interactive scene with UE4duino (https://github.com/RVillani/UE4Duino).</p>
                    <p>The sensor's behaviour varies greatly between daytime, and night light indoors. An auto-exposure like function could be in the plans for the future.</p>

                    <p>In the electronics production week, I created Neil's SAMD11C serial adapter design. Although the board worked fine as an echo board, I have not been able to program another board with it until now.</p>
                    <p>This week I figured out that the (insert link), bootloader only works when programming other SAMD11C's, and the (insert link) bootloader makes the board programmable via Arduino IDE.</p>
                    <p>I have located (insert link) bootloader that actually makes the board function as a serial programmer for AVR's. However, the board can not receive signal from the programmed board.</p>
                    <p>I have fount this (insert link) Arduiono sketch that should be what I need, but it does not compile, and is beyond my current C++ ability to debug.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do I enable this board to receive signal from a serial connection?</li>

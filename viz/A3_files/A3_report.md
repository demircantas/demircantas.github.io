## Reading critique
![spiral image](https://vis-society.github.io/assets/imgs/covid-spiral.png)

## observations
- COVID-19 cases exhibited strong seasonal trends, with notable peaks in January 2021 and September 2021, followed by another sharp increase in January 2022.
- The winter of 2020-2021 saw a major surge in cases, which subsided in the spring and summer before rising again in the fall.
- The Omicron wave in early 2022 led to a dramatic spike in cases, surpassing previous peaks with a steep gradient, indicating a rapid spread.
- The visualization’s spiral structure highlights that case surges tend to occur around the same time each year, reinforcing the cyclical nature of COVID-19 waves.
- Unlike prior peaks, the Omicron wave’s extreme rise suggests a fundamentally different rate of transmission, supporting the article’s discussion on its high contagiousness.

## critique of the given visualization

The spiral visualization is an engaging and visually striking design that effectively captures the cyclical nature of COVID-19 waves. Its shape naturally draws the viewer’s eye outward, emphasizing the escalation of cases over time. Additionally, the metaphorical association of a spiral—potentially symbolizing loss of control or turbulence—reinforces the uncertainty and volatility of the pandemic.

However, while the visualization succeeds in evoking an emotional response, it poses challenges for precise data interpretation. The varying radius of the spiral makes it difficult to directly compare case counts across different points in time. While the format facilitates seasonal comparisons, it obscures month-to-month trends and makes it hard to extract exact values from the width of the spiral. Adding labeled case counts at key peaks and troughs could help anchor the viewer’s understanding. Furthermore, the choice of colors could be expanded to encode additional information, such as the relative severity of different waves (e.g., differentiating Omicron’s high transmissibility but lower severity from earlier waves). Lastly, the off-center nature of the spiral raises questions about whether this was an intentional design decision, possibly inspired by the Golden Ratio, or an unintended distortion. Addressing these concerns could improve the balance between aesthetic appeal and clarity while maintaining the visualization’s ability to engage and inform.

1. Landmark moments such as previous peaks and lows could be marked on the visualization with brief descriptions.
2. Number of cases are hard to read from the width of the spiral shape. Numbers of cases in a few moments could be placed as labels for reference.
3. The spiral format favors comparisons among seasons of different years. However, precise comparisons are difficult due to the changing radius of the spiral curve.
4. The design choice also reminds me of the term, "spiral out of control", or a cyclone, emphasizing how volatile the situation might become.
5. The comparison of the Omicron variant being less sever but more contagious is an important piece of information from the article. Color could be used as a channel to communicate information like the severity of cases.
6. The spiral being off-center reminds me of the Golden ratio. I wonder if this is an aesthetically informed decision.

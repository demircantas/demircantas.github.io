			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How does single-family zoning contribute to the housing shortage in Massachusetts municipalities?</li>
				<li>How do racial demographics relate to zoning policies and economic disparities?</li>
				<li>How does zoning impact income distribution across municipalities?</li>
				<!-- <li>...</li> -->
				<!-- <p>
					My motivation for these questions stems from a desire to understand how transit infrastructure can shape urban dynamics and improve quality of life. By focusing on the MBTA network, I aim to explore how transit connectivity (node value) relates to population density, how proximity to transit enhances urban amenities (place value), and how these factors influence property values (market value). This inquiry is inspired by the comprehensive 3V approach, which emphasizes the interconnected benefits of effective transit-oriented development as described in the World Bank article <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/transport/publication/transforming-the-urban-space-through-transit-oriented-development-the-3v-approach" target="_blank">Transforming the Urban Space Through Transit-Oriented Development: The 3V Approach</a>. Analyzing these aspects will not only shed light on the current state of urban development in transit-accessible areas but also provide insights into potential strategies for sustainable growth.

			<h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>
			
			<p>
				Zoning regulations play a crucial role in determining housing availability, affordability, and economic distribution. Our analysis explores how single-family zoning contributes to housing shortages, the relationship between zoning policies and racial demographics, and the impact of zoning on wealth concentration.
			</p>

			<h3>Research Questions</h3>
			<p>
				This analysis focuses on understanding zoning patterns and their implications for urban planning.
				We aim to answer the following questions:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>How do zoning classifications correlate with demographic and economic indicators?</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Are there spatial trends in zoning policies that indicate socioeconomic disparities?</strong></li>
				<li><strong>What insights can be drawn about land use and development patterns from zoning data?</strong></li>
			</ol>


			<!-- <p> For this assignment I will be focusing on the MBTA network datasets provided for the assignment including MBTA lines, stops, and their buffered versions. </p>
			<p> Upon finding out that the lines are limited to shape features with shapes and identifiers, I decided to explore single family zoning datasets to better address my questions. </p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
				This exploratory analysis highlights the significant role of zoning in shaping urban demographics and economic structures. Findings indicate that single-family zoning contributes to housing shortages, economic segregation, and wealth concentration in high-income municipalities. Additionally, correlations between race and economic status suggest that zoning policies have historically reinforced disparities. Future research could refine these findings by incorporating inflation-adjusted income data and examining municipal zoning laws in greater detail.

			<h2>Subtheme: [Subtheme: Zoning and Housing Supply]</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How does single-family zoning contribute to the housing shortage in Massachusetts municipalities?</li>
				<li>How do racial demographics relate to zoning policies and economic disparities?</li>
				<li>How does zoning impact income distribution across municipalities?</li>
				<!-- <li>...</li> -->
				<!-- <p>
					My motivation for these questions stems from a desire to understand how transit infrastructure can shape urban dynamics and improve quality of life. By focusing on the MBTA network, I aim to explore how transit connectivity (node value) relates to population density, how proximity to transit enhances urban amenities (place value), and how these factors influence property values (market value). This inquiry is inspired by the comprehensive 3V approach, which emphasizes the interconnected benefits of effective transit-oriented development as described in the World Bank article <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/transport/publication/transforming-the-urban-space-through-transit-oriented-development-the-3v-approach" target="_blank">Transforming the Urban Space Through Transit-Oriented Development: The 3V Approach</a>. Analyzing these aspects will not only shed light on the current state of urban development in transit-accessible areas but also provide insights into potential strategies for sustainable growth.

			<h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>
			
			<p>
				Zoning regulations play a crucial role in determining housing availability, affordability, and economic distribution. Our analysis explores how single-family zoning contributes to housing shortages, the relationship between zoning policies and racial demographics, and the impact of zoning on wealth concentration.
			</p>

			<h3>Research Questions</h3>
			<p>
				This analysis focuses on understanding zoning patterns and their implications for urban planning.
				We aim to answer the following questions:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>How do zoning classifications correlate with demographic and economic indicators?</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Are there spatial trends in zoning policies that indicate socioeconomic disparities?</strong></li>
				<li><strong>What insights can be drawn about land use and development patterns from zoning data?</strong></li>
			</ol>


			<!-- <p> For this assignment I will be focusing on the MBTA network datasets provided for the assignment including MBTA lines, stops, and their buffered versions. </p>
			<p> Upon finding out that the lines are limited to shape features with shapes and identifiers, I decided to explore single family zoning datasets to better address my questions. </p>

				<figcaption>Upon comparing the number of municipalities with the number of unique municipalities, we find that there are 52 duplicate municipalities. This might be due to a double entry error, or multiple municipal entities in the same geographical location. For the remainder of the exercise, we assume that the duplication arises from an error.This figure displays the comparisons of numeric columns for Brookline. 52 municipalities have duplicate entries. Here we visualize Brookline with red and blue displaying values from different instances.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/45PHfdb.png" alt="Municipality Shape Files" />
				<figcaption>We observe that Brookline, like other duplicate municipalities, has different shape files corresponding to different instances. Here, we also observe that the shapes are not just boundaries. They include other features that clutter our visualization.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4bRRXpa.png" alt="Cleaned Boundaries" />
				<figcaption>To avoid visual clutter, we used shapes from the provided <code>metro_boston_municipalities.geojson</code>. We joined this to our main <code>housing_sf_other_w_census.geojson</code> dataset using the `muni` field.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nRrgGzz.png" alt="Population Distributions" />
				<figcaption>We observe minimum and maximum populations and find out that multiple municipalities have populations of 0. We will repeat this observation after combining duplicate municipalities. We see here that 16 municipalities have 0 population. We later find that a majority of these instances are from duplicate entries. We combine duplicate entries by summing their quantity values and averaging percentages.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W33Poyr.png" alt="Family Households" />
				<figcaption>Even after combining duplicate entries, we find that 5 municipalities have 0 family households.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OuNKUcl.png" alt="Population vs Family Households" />
				<figcaption>Plotting family households against population, we find that Burlington, Chelsea, Everett and Somerville have 0 family households. We later find that these municipalities have 0 population, even after the merge. We filter these entries for further work.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DP1dtNe.png" alt="Population Histogram" />
				<figcaption>Here we visualize a histogram of population underlining municipalities with minimum, median and maximum values. We confirm the filter operation via a histogram of number of municipalities against population.</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/U5Oj689.png" alt="Income vs Race" />
				<figcaption>For a preliminary check to evaluate income against racial distribution, we look at households with income under \$10,000.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>The <code>Distribution of Households Across Income Brackets</code> chart presents the average number of households across different income brackets.</figcaption>
			</figure>

				 One <strong>unexpected</strong> observation stands out:</p>

				<ul>
    				<li><strong>The Highest Income Bracket Has the Greatest Number of Households</strong><br>
        				Unlike typical income distributions, where middle-income brackets often dominate, this dataset suggests that <strong>households earning over $200,000 per year</strong> are the most common.
    				</li>
    				<li><strong>The Median Income Bracket Has the Fewest Households</strong><br>
        				Few households report incomes in the lowest bracket, which could reflect economic conditions in the studied region.
    				</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Possible Explanations for the Wealth-Dominant Trend</h3>

				<ol>
    				<li><strong>Boston Metropolitan Area is Wealthier than Expected</strong><br>
        				The dataset might reflect the high-income nature of the region, especially with affluent suburbs included.
    				</li>
    				<li><strong>The Income Brackets are Capped</strong><br>
        				The highest income bracket is <strong>$200,000 and above</strong>, meaning it could be absorbing households making much more (e.g., $500K, $1M+). A lack of finer granularity at the high end limits visibility into true income distribution.
    				</li>
    				<li><strong>The Dataset May Need Inflation Adjustment</strong><br>
        				If the dataset was created several years ago, the income brackets might not accurately reflect today's purchasing power. Adjusting for <strong>inflation</strong> might shift the balance of household distribution across brackets.
    				</li>
				</ol>

        			<h3>Key Insights</h3>
        			<p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Strongest Negative Correlation</strong> â†’ <code>perc_white</code> vs. <code>perc_low_inc</code><br>
        			- Suggests that municipalities with a higher percentage of White households tend to have <strong>fewer</strong> low-income households.</p>

        			<p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Strongest Positive Correlation</strong> â†’ <code>perc_black_</code> vs. <code>perc_low_inc</code><br>
        			- Indicates that areas with a higher percentage of Black households <strong>tend to have more low-income households</strong>.</p>

        			<p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Weak or Mixed Correlations</strong><br>
        			- <code>perc_black_</code> vs. <code>perc_high_inc</code> is weaker, implying income diversity among Black households across municipalities.</p>

        			<h3>What This Tells Us</h3>
        			<ul>
            			<li><strong>Economic disparities exist</strong> across racial lines.</li>
            			<li><strong>Other factors need to be considered</strong> (education, housing policies, urban planning) to fully understand these relationships.</li>
            			<li><strong>Further Investigation Needed</strong> â†’ Is this correlation causal or reflective of larger systemic factors?</li>
        			</ul>

        			<p>While correlation does <strong>not imply causation</strong>, these patterns <strong>warrant deeper analysis into socioeconomic factors</strong> that shape economic disparities.</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
				This exploratory analysis highlights the significant role of zoning in shaping urban demographics and economic structures. Findings indicate that single-family zoning contributes to housing shortages, economic segregation, and wealth concentration in high-income municipalities. Additionally, correlations between race and economic status suggest that zoning policies have historically reinforced disparities. Future research could refine these findings by incorporating inflation-adjusted income data and examining municipal zoning laws in greater detail.

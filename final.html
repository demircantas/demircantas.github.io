                    <h2>Update</h2>
                    <p>Using the laser cutter, I created the folding chassis prototypes out of cardboard, and played around with my press fit kit from <a href="week1.html">week 1</a>. During laser cutting, I noticed some overlapping lines, which almost became a fire hazard. I figured out that the when the 3d model is unfolded, some lines overlap.</p>

                <button class="collapsible">Update (Week 8)</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>After the ideation phase of molding & casting week, I decided to make the rover smaller for added cuteness, and easier production to (maybe) make more than a single one.</p>
                    <p>So far I have:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <a href="week7.html#prototype_cad">prototype</a>  for the body design.</li>
                        <img src="assets/final/update1/IMG_20211109_140851.jpg" alt="body", width="720">
                        <li>AVR based <a href="week8.html">board design</a>, and working prototypes that have a photoresistor and can communicate through serial.</li>
                        <img src="assets/final/update1/IMG_20211109_141001.jpg" alt="board", width="720">
                    </ul>
                    <p>I still need:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A board design with photoresistors on four corners.</li>
                        <li>Software to calculate a vector from the voltage difference between four sensors</li>
                        <li>Software to convert the vector to a two channel signal to drive the wheels (similar to how a tank steers)</li>
                        <li>A modular board setup that may integrate motors, drivers, and sensors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What works:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BLKCXL4/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B08BLKCXL4&pd_rd_w=lByvV&pf_rd_p=887084a2-5c34-4113-a4f8-b7947847c308&pd_rd_wg=9KPHC&pf_rd_r=BPV1S9FDZVS0X32JZEXW&pd_rd_r=51f39960-23c7-4fd3-9b48-b42afa9245d4&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQkE0RlZZMUdVWUFVJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDA4OTM3VTdRTzZZQzQ4SDRDJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTEwMzg0ODAzUVEwSk1QWjcwMEtSJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfZGV0YWlsJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==">FTDI to USB cable</a> based on <a href="https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DS_FT232R.pdf">DS_FT232R</a> works flawlessly so far for programming and communicating with my boards based on ATTiny412.</li>
                        <li>Photoresistors provide analog signal with far greater precision than I would expect</li>
                        <li>ATTiny is far easier to design and produce around than SAMD11c</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What does not work:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My SAMD11c based serial programmer can program AVR boards, but can not communicate with them. I understand that the board design is physically capable, with TX and RX running through the six pin serial conector, but I am having trouble with the software. The <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/ulb/students/quentin-bolsee/3d/project_d11c_serial/D11C_serial_8E2.bin">bootloader</a> that I am using are binary files which I can not modify. I located a <a href="https://github.com/qbolsee/SAMD11C_serial/blob/main/SAMD11C_serial/SAMD11C_serial.ino">.ino sketch</a> which does not compile due to an error ("'Serial2' was not declared in this scope").</li>
                        <img src="assets/final/update1/IMG_20211109_141017.jpg" alt="Serial programmer", width="720">
                        <li>ARM based designs with USB input are more tedious to design, with connections to USB and the programming connector, require shimming all the time, and are slower and less efficient to load sketches on (due to the need for a bootloader). But they do work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Questions to resolve:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do I make/program a D11c serial programmer that can program and communicate with AVR based PCB's?</li>
                        <li>How do I connect motors to my board? What size motors, boards, batteries, peripherals do I need?</li>
                        <li>How do I upgrade the system to one with ESP32CAM's if I want to use a more sophisticated, computer vision based sensing moethod? Can I have a modular design where I can add/remove the ESP32?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What happens when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Board design with four sensors, in the following week</li>
                        <li>I resolve motors, batteries in the output week</li>
                        <li>I get my serial programmer to communicate for independence from a cable adapter that I can not make myself. This is not urgent, but I want to be able use my own programmer</li>
                        <li>A new design iteration based on motor, wheel, battery, peripheral size, after sorting out motors</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What I learned:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soldering joints</li>
                        <li>How to design, fabricate, and program AVR's and ARM's</li>
                        <li>Creating programmers for AVR's and ARM's</li>
                        <li>Testing my boards with blink, button, and echo setups</li>
                        <li>Using molds to rapidly create multiple physical parts with materials that I can not 3d print conveniently</li>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>This week, I built a prototype with 4 phototransistors, 4 vibromotors, an FTDI serial connection and an LED, around an ATTiny1614.</p>

                    <p>My first milling attempt was a little rough towards one side due to poor adhesion, yet it was functional after a light pass with sandpaper. I decided to recycle the first attempt as a platform to solder vibro motors, and build a new board just to be safe.</p>
                    <p>I wrote a basic software for the board, that reads analogue signals from each sensor, multiplies it by a value, and sends it as an analog/pwm signal to the corresponding vibromotor.</p>

                    <p>The rover does freak out in the dark, and somewhat seeks light. However, the code does not yet include the vector representation, and the rover ends up rotating right. I need to calibrate sensors in a balance state.</p>

                    <p>I also discovered bristle bots, which typically are simpler versions of my project with just a battery and one vibromotor connected to a tootbrush head. However, I discovered one video where two brushes are used like tank threads, wirelessly connected to a gamepad resulting in somewhat controllable movement.</p>
                    <p>I tried different approaches for 3d printing legs of <a href="https://github.com/osbock/droobots"> brushes</a>, ending up modifying a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17879"> design with curved legs</a> that proved to be the most controllable.</p>

                    <p>By running vibromotors at different speeds (with PWM), and in different configurations, I can make the bot:</p>

                        <li>Go straight (RR, FL)</li>

                    <p>The combinations are quite unintuitive. Possibly because the center of gravity is in an awkward position, and there are performance differences among vibro motors.</p>

                    <p>I will update my code to include a state machine with different motor combinations for steering.</p>
                    <p>I need a function that takes 2 dimensional vectors which I acquire from signal difference among four phototransistors on each corner of the rover. The function should switch states based on thresholds in vector axes.</p>

                    <p>Using my boards from networking week, I connected an ESP32 to my main ATTiny1614 board, which then connects directly to the motors. The motors are rated for 4.5 volts, however I can run them two at a time from a 3.5 Volt LiPo battery, and even 2 volts from a power supply. However, when I connect motors directly to the microcontroller, I get no movement.</p>

                    <p>Checking with the multimeter, I noticed no resistence between the ground and power pins on the motors.</p>
